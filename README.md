# Intro
Code served as background for bachelor's thesis together with a second repository. The goal of this thesis was to optimize sizing of charging stations based on preprocessed GPS data. In this repo are different experiments with optimization methods and their resutls, i.e. different sizing and its performance in charging scenarios. The second repository consists of database initialization and data preprocessing scripts. Unfortunately, some of the used data are private due to privacy issues and NDA.
